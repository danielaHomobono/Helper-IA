I visited the doctor's office and with the elevated enzyme levels they diagnosed that I've had an acute pancreatitis. Currently, I'm admitted at the hospital on medications intravenously. I'd need to be at the hospital before I'm better to be discharged from here. I'd need to apply for sick leave for about 6 days starting Dec 12, 2016 onwards. Kindly approve my sick leave. I'd submit all the necessary medical records once I'm back home discharged from the hospital. Thank you!
