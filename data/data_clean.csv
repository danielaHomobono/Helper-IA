there is a personal issue in our team structure that I need to share with you. I work in my current team for about nine years now and my current manager is with us for about seven years. At first, I got to know her as a fair and honourable person. 
But in the past few years, I have witnessed again and again that my manager is favouring a certain colleague in our team. 
My suspicion was first raised when that colleague was promoted to T3 way before her peers even though she does not take more responsibility than average or shows significantly better result. Plus, although it is important for everyone in the team to regularly attend conferences, the favourited colleage gets to attend these conferences at least twice as often as other colleagues in our team. 
There are many other examples that strengthed my suspicion and I do not want to go into details now. 
I am not sure how to address this properly. I have not confronted my manager or my colleague about this. But I definitely do not want to leave this unadressed. Could you please help me / us as a team to address this issue in the right way?

Unfortunately, my manager has changed end of last year, and he did not apply the decision from previous manager, and I get the minimal increase of 1,2% which is unfair.
